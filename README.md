# Controlling-Relay-Boards-for-Home-Automation
The control is not very difficult, since only GPIOs have to be switched. You can use C++ (wiringPi) or Python for it. I am using Python and have used two pins (12 &amp; 24) for the same.
In this, I have given the user all possible options to select from in order to turn ON/OFF the relay.
The Raspberry Pi computer/device, although a powerful device, works on a 3.3V Logic. Controlling relay and relay boards is the first step towards home automation.
A simulator (https://create.withcode.uk/) for Raspberry Pi was used for illustration.
